If not treated properly, the metabolic condition diabetes mellitus (DM) can have major negative effects on one's health. Traditional blood glucose monitors are painful and uncomfortable for individuals since they are intrusive. As a result, the study's objective was to non-invasively measure blood glucose using a machine learning technique. This project involves using almost-infrared light to measure the glucose concentration in the blood fingertips by absorbing and disperse the light through the blood process. The procedure can also provide painless, convenient, and economical alternatives to these devices
